        "# A GIS-based framework that identifies priority areas for stormwater management near MS4 sewer sites in Washington, DC.\n",

        "\n",
        "The pollution of urban rivers in Washington DC is classifiable by two distinct sources and their corresponding infrastructure. DC, like many urban areas, has a large share of impervious surfaces which prevent the infiltration of rainwater during storms. As a consequence, large volumes of rainwater have the ability to accumulate during and after storms which overwhelms existing infrastructure and results in the release of mixed excess stormwater and raw sewage to the Potomac River and its tributaries. The objective of this study is to develop a simplified tool that identifies water pollution severity at sewer outflow sites. The model will assess sewer outflow points across DC and provide a weighted multi-criteria analysis of at-risk areas based on watershed, sewershed, and vulnerable communities. Moreover, this analysis is aggragated at the Census Tract scale.\n",

The lowest group (pale yellow), scaling between 0.17 to 0.38, represents areas within the Potomac watershed, wards 1 or 2, and may or may not fall within the MS4 sewershed. The middle ranking (orange), ranging between 0.38 and 0.72, signifies areas from a part of all watersheds, wards 3, 4, 5, and 6; and/or regions that may or may not fall within the MS4 sewershed. And finally, the highest scoring group (red) has scores between 0.72 and 1. This region highlights areas mostly within wards 7 and 8 (some from wards 4, 5, and 6); Anacostia Watershed and some from Rock Creek, and. To better interpret the impact of MCE scores on geographical analysis, it may be beneficial to classify scores into more groups. However, for the purpose of visual interpretation, it was better to delineated the scores into three groups."
